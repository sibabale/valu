# Technical Debt & Future Improvements

## Overview
This document tracks technical debt, corners we're cutting in our MVP, and prioritized improvements for future iterations.

## Priority Levels
- **ðŸ”´ HIGH**: Critical for production, security, or user experience
- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Important for scalability and maintainability  
- **ðŸŸ¢ LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

## ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY

### 1. Cache Expansion & Quota Optimization
**Current State**: 5 hardcoded companies, 1-day cache, manual building
**Impact**: Limited home page content, poor user experience, inefficient API usage
**Cost**: Users see only 5 companies, daily cache loss, wasted API quota
**Solution**: 
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Expand to 20 companies (immediate improvement)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Max out daily quota (500 calls) to build substantial cache
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Extend cache TTL to 1 week (survive quota exhaustion)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Automated weekly cache refresh (sustainable model)

**Strategic Rationale**:
- **20 companies** = Better home page experience
- **Max daily quota** = Build cache once, serve many users
- **1-week cache** = Survive quota exhaustion, maintain user experience
- **Weekly refresh** = Sustainable data freshness without daily quota pressure

### 2. Cache Persistence
**Current State**: In-memory cache (lost on restart)
**Impact**: Users lose all cached companies when API restarts
**Cost**: Poor user experience, repeated API calls
**Solution**: 
- [ ] Implement persistent cache (SQLite/JSON file)
- [ ] Cache survives API restarts
- [ ] Reduce API calls for returning users

### 3. API Rate Limiting Improvements
**Current State**: Blocking `WaitForRateLimit()` method
**Impact**: Thread pool starvation, poor performance
**Cost**: Scalability issues, cascading delays
**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement non-blocking rate limiting
- [ ] Use `SemaphoreSlim` or fail-fast approach
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern

### 4. Error Handling & Graceful Degradation
**Current State**: Basic try-catch, no fallbacks
**Impact**: API failures break entire system
**Cost**: Poor user experience when Alpha Vantage is down
**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement fallback to cached data
- [ ] Add health checks for Alpha Vantage
- [ ] Graceful error messages to users

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 4. Search Functionality Enhancement
**Current State**: Symbol-only search (2-5 characters)
**Impact**: Limited search capability
**Cost**: Users can't find companies by name
**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement `SYMBOL_SEARCH` Alpha Vantage function
- [ ] Natural language search (company names)
- [ ] Fuzzy matching for typos

### 5. Automated Cache Building
**Current State**: Manual cache building via endpoint
**Impact**: Requires manual intervention
**Cost**: Operational overhead, inconsistent data
**Solution**:
- [ ] Scheduled cache building (cron job)
- [ ] Automated daily refresh
- [ ] Background cache warming

### 6. Financial Data Completeness
**Current State**: Missing price/change data (set to 0)
**Impact**: Incomplete company information
**Cost**: Poor user experience, missing key metrics
**Solution**:
- [ ] Add `GLOBAL_QUOTE` calls for price data
- [ ] Hybrid approach: OVERVIEW + QUOTE
- [ ] Cache price data separately (more frequent updates)

### 7. Pagination & Performance
**Current State**: No real pagination, returns all cached companies
**Impact**: Poor performance with large datasets
**Cost**: Memory usage, slow responses
**Solution**:
- [ ] Implement proper pagination
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Lazy loading of company details

---

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY

### 8. Logging & Monitoring
**Current State**: Console.WriteLine logging
**Impact**: No production monitoring
**Cost**: Difficult debugging, no performance insights
**Solution**:
- [ ] Structured logging (Serilog)
- [ ] Application insights/metrics
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### 9. Configuration Management
**Current State**: Hardcoded values in code
**Impact**: Difficult to configure for different environments
**Cost**: Deployment complexity
**Solution**:
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration
- [ ] Feature flags for A/B testing
- [ ] Configuration validation

### 10. Testing Coverage
**Current State**: No automated tests
**Impact**: Risk of regressions
**Cost**: Manual testing overhead
**Solution**:
- [ ] Unit tests for services
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical flows

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### High Impact, Low Effort (Do First)
1. **Cache Persistence** - High user impact, medium effort
2. **Error Handling** - High reliability impact, low effort
3. **Search Enhancement** - High user impact, medium effort

### High Impact, High Effort (Plan Carefully)
1. **Rate Limiting** - High scalability impact, high effort
2. **Automated Cache Building** - High operational impact, high effort

### Low Impact, Low Effort (Do When Convenient)
1. **Logging Improvements** - Low user impact, low effort
2. **Configuration Management** - Low user impact, low effort

## Notes
- This document should be updated as priorities change
- Each improvement should be tracked as a separate issue/task
- Regular reviews of technical debt should be conducted
- Balance between new features and debt reduction
